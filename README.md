# WeBib!

WeBib! is a web application that manages bibliography data. You can enter data for books, articles, book chapters, multi-volume works, and more, and you can collect your entries into different collections. Then, simply select your bibliography style, and WeBib! instantly creates a bibliography in your chosen style. Simply click "copy", and then paste your bibliography into your research paper. Want to add your own style? You can do that too.

WeBib! was built entirely by Brian Embry with React on the front end and Express and MongoDB on the back end.
