functionality to add
-Suffixes like Jr. (see MLA 187)
-citing introduction, preface, foreword, afterword (MLA 194); the difficulty here is that the intro and book have different authors; probably need a separate entry Type for this.
-apa6 styles change is mysteriously affecting standardStyles at styles.js 256; looks like a ES6 problem.

-alerts for errors?
-add captia to register/continue options
-add email api: send feedback form. recover lost password

Refactors
-refactor search algorithms: get innermostValues, return innermostValues.find(value => value ===target)

Questions
-My post route to entries is returning status 500, but it still works. What't the deal?
-currently I load all entries to newEntry and filter on search. Is that scalable? Probably not.
